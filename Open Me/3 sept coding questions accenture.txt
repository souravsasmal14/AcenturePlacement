Hello all!!!
Accenture coding questions asked for me
1. Checking whether password follows certain rules(given)... rules like character greater than 6 and less than 22, one uppercase, one lowercase, two special characters(had given certain characters), one numeric digit, no two characters appear consecutively.
If password is right, return 0. Otherwise return number of rules not followed.
Example: 
I/p: abcd
O/p: 4

I/p: Abc@12#
O/p: 0


2. Given a string and a integer k, need to arrange the k characters in increasing and decreasing order(alternatively). The pattern to be followed for the order "abcdefghstuvwxyzijklmnopqr"
Example:
I/p: tomcat
O/p: tocmat
to is in increasing order... mc is not in decreasing, so interchange
